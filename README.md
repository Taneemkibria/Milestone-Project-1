## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First-Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be met with a simple clean home page that highlights that it is a website for a gym.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want the most important pages to be visible upon first glance when looking at the navigation bar. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website to find information.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to find the contact information easily to solve any queries that I might have, or has not been answered on the site.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about the pricing, opening hours and classes.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the location of the gym.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any discounts or new plans/pricing.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new classes.           

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are #1791b1 - a shade of blue, and white. Originally I thought of having 3 main colours including a shade of pink or dark blue but decided against it as it would be overwhelming and too busy.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Robot font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the choice of font doesn't get imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font that I have seen being used throughout my course hence why I chose it.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to  catch the user's attention and set the tone for the page. It shows a clean and modern looking gym, conincing customers to join.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be met with a simple clean home page which highlights that it is a website for a gym.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text that highlights that the gym is open 24/7 and a "Join Now" Call to action button that leads to the contact us now page.
        2. The user has two options, click the call to action button or scroll down to learn more about the gym.

    2.   As a First Time Visitor, I want the most important pages to be visible upon first glance when looking at the navigation bar. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website to find information.

        1. At the top of each page there is a navigation bar, each link simply describes the page they will end up at.
        2. The prices and other information can be accessed on the home page by scrolling.

    3.  As a First Time visitor, I want to be able to find the contact information easily to solve any queries that I might have, or has not been answered on the site.

        1. The contact us page link can be seen clearly in the navigation bar on each page 
        2. A from conatining a message box can be used for queries on the contact us page.
        3. At the bottom of the page there are social media icons which direct to the companies social pages where they can also be contacted.
        

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about the pricing, opening hours and classes.

        1. The pricing can be found through scrolling down on the home page and is under the clear heading 'Pricing'.
        2. Information on the classes can be found by scrolling down on the home page under the heading 'classes' where a little insight is given. More information on the classes can be found on the classes page which is in the navbar. 
        3. Opening hours are 24/7 which can be seen first thing on the home page on the hero image. If this were to be missed by the user they can contact the company through various means on the contact us page. 
    
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the location of the gym.

        1. On the contact us page, there is a reasonably sized map with the address of the gym and a little pinpoint on the map which also shows the location.


-   #### Frequent User Goals    

    1.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any discounts or new plans/pricing.

        1. This can be checked easily by scrolling down on the home page. In hindsight, I will be looking to add an alert banner or a newsletter option to make it easier for customers to be notified of discounts.

    
     2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new classes.
        
        1. New classes can be checked in the classes page that can be found in the navbar. I do think a newsletter would be more convenient and will probably be something that I do after the end of the course when I have more time.
